          <h2>Michael Bay</h2>
          <p>
            Bay got his start in the film industry interning with George Lucas
            when he was 15, filing the storyboards for Raiders of the Lost Ark,
            which he thought was going to be terrible. His opinion changed after
            seeing it in the theater and he was so impressed by the experience
            that he decided to become a film director.</p>
            
            <p>
            He graduated fromWesleyan University in 1986, majoring in both English 
            and film. He
            was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity and a favorite student of
            film historian Jeanine Basinger. For his graduate work, he attended
            Art Center College of Design in Pasadena where he also studied film.
            Bay began working at Propaganda Films, directing commercials and
            music videos, two weeks after finishing his postgraduate degree.</p>
          
          <p> His
            90-second World War IIâ€“inspired Coca-Cola advertisement was picked
            up by Capitol Records. His first national commercial was for the Red
            Cross, which won a Clio Award in 1992.[21][22] He directed Goodby,
            Silverstein & Partners' "Got Milk?" ad campaign for the California
            Milk Processors Board in 1993, which also won a Grand Prix Clio
            Award for Commercial of the Year.</p>
            
            <p>Bay's success in music videos
            gained the attention of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson,
            who selected him to direct his first feature-length film, Bad Boys.
            It was shot in Miami in 1994 and starred Will Smith and Martin
            Lawrence. The action film was a breakout role for Smith, who was
            making a transition from television at the time. Shooting in Miami
            was a good experience for Bay, who would later own a home in the
            city and spend a great deal of time there. The film was completed
            for $19 million and grossed a remarkable $141 million in the summer
            of 1995. Bay's success led to a strong partnership and friendship
            with Jerry Bruckheimer.</p>
