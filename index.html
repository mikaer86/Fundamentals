          <h2>Michael Bay</h2>
          <h3>Bio:</h3>
          <p>
            Bay got his start in the film industry interning with George Lucas
            when he was 15, filing the storyboards for Raiders of the Lost Ark,
            which he thought was going to be terrible. His opinion changed after
            seeing it in the theater and he was so impressed by the experience
            that he decided to become a film director.[16] He graduated from
            Wesleyan University in 1986, majoring in both English and
            film.[17][18] He was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity and a
            favorite student of film historian Jeanine Basinger. For his
            graduate work, he attended Art Center College of Design in Pasadena
            where he also studied film. Bay began working at Propaganda Films,
            directing commercials and music videos, two weeks after finishing
            his postgraduate degree.[20] His 90-second World War IIâ€“inspired
            Coca-Cola advertisement was picked up by Capitol Records. His first
            national commercial was for the Red Cross, which won a Clio Award in
            1992.[21][22] He directed Goodby, Silverstein & Partners' "Got
            Milk?" ad campaign for the California Milk Processors Board in 1993,
            which also won a Grand Prix Clio Award for Commercial of the Year.
            Bay's success in music videos gained the attention of producers
            Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who selected him to direct his
            first feature-length film, Bad Boys. It was shot in Miami in 1994
            and starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The action film was a
            breakout role for Smith, who was making a transition from television
            at the time. Shooting in Miami was a good experience for Bay, who
            would later own a home in the city and spend a great deal of time
            there.[25] The film was completed for $19 million and grossed a
            remarkable $141 million in the summer of 1995.[26] Bay's success led
            to a strong partnership and friendship with Jerry Bruckheimer.
